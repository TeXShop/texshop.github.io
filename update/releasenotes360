TeXShop Changes 3.60

1) Updated to Sparkle 1.13.1 for security reasons.

2) TeXShop no longer adds a creator and type to files it writes. These were obsolete from the Classic version of the file system.

3) The command "Set TeXShop as Default TeX Editor" is now active when either the Source or Preview window is active

4) Slight cleanup in English and Korean localization.
